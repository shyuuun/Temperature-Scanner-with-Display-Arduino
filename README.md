# Temperature-Scanner-with-Display-Arduino


## Components needed: 
  
  a. Arduino Uno 
  
  b. 0.96" OLED 64x128 Display Module
  
  c. Jumper Wires
  
  d. Breadboard 
  
  e. DHT11 (Temp and Humid Sensor)
  
  
 ## How to connect:
 
 DHT11 -> DigitalPin 2
       -> 5V
       -> GND
       
 OLED -> SCC to A5
      -> SDA to A4
      -> VCC to 5V
      -> GND
      
and then upload the code
